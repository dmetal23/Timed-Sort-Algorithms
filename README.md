# Timed-Sort-Algorithms
A combinatorics related timed-sort test to demonstrate the difference in time complexity between insertion sort, quick sort, merge sort, shell sort, and selection sort. 

Separate tests can be found in the .docx file that were done to determine the threshold for which insertion sort is faster than merge sort.
